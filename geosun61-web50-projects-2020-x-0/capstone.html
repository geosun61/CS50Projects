    <h4><b>About My Capstone Project</b></h4>
    <br>
    <p>
      In this section of the website I will go over the final capstone project I worked on last semester.
      The capstone project uses a Raspberry Pi 4, Android App and a Firebase database. The Raspberry Pi
      controls the sensors/effectors for the project which are an <b>IR Break Beam Sensor</b>,
      <b>VCNL 4010</b>, <b>HD Camera</b>, and <b>2 Servo-Motors</b>. All sensors were programmed with
      Python on the Raspberry Pi. The Android app was programmed in the Android Studio IDE with Java and XML.
      The Firebase database provided by Google was used to store data entered from the Android app
      which then the data can be pulled from there and used on the Raspberry Pi. Each sensor and sensor is
      placed on the final PCB design which will be shown here at the bottom of the page.

          <td class="senfunc">
            The IR Break Beam for this project is used as and entry/exit. The IR Break Beam
            sensor has two parts one is a receiver and the other is a transmitter. The
            receiver has 3 wires power, ground and output. Once the receiver receives an
            IR bream it will send a digital output. The digital output in this project is
            used to show if an object has approached the entry/exit.

          <td class="senfunc">
            VCNL4010 is placed a parking spot to detect if a car is parked or not in the spot.
            The VCNL sensor is an I2C device that detects if an object approaches the sensor
            and reports on the distance of the object form the sensor. The sensor was programmed
            to send data to the Firebase database to report on if a car has parked in the parking
            spot. It would send a boolean value if a car has parked in the spot or not.

          <td class="senfunc">The 2 servomotors were used as a entry and exit barriers. The servo motor
            Python script was activated once the IR Break Beam code sent a boolean value if an object has
            approached the entance. The servo motor had a barrier attached to its shaft and would lift the
            barrier once the license plate detection is true.

          <td> <img src="img\yoluke hd camera.jpg" alt="HD Camera" class="senImg"><br><i>HD Camera</i> </td>
          <td class="senfunc">
            The HD Camera is used at the entrance at the parking lot to take a picture of the license plate
            of the model cars. The script ot take a picture is activated when the IR Break Beam sensor detects
            if the beam is broken. A picture is taken and is analyzed by an image recognition program. Once the
            image recognition is done it will send a string value and then it is compared to a value from Firebase.
            The value from Firebase is entered from our Android app on the Add a Car page where they enter
            information about their car. If the license plate string from Firebase and image recognition are the
            same then the car is allowed for entry.
