        <h5>PC Building</h5>

        I am passionate about building PCs from scratch, buying all the parts
        required and then building it. I recently built a PC with a
        <a href="https://www.zotac.com/product/graphics_card/zotac-gaming-geforce-rtx-2070-mini">RTX 2070</a>,
        <a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/z390-a-pro">MSI Z390-A Pro Motherboard</a>,
        <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/186604/intel-core-i7-9700k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html">Intel i7 9700k</a> processor, and 16GB of RAM.
        I run my games on it as well as complete my assignments that are required
        for school. I added a
        <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/coolers/cpu-air-coolers/hyper-212-rgb-black-edition/">RGB Air Cooler fan</a>
        for the processor. I installed Windows 10 and I have some Linux VM machines running as well on it.
        This PC is powerful and can support what I need to do for school as well as gaming.

        <h5>Gaming</h5>
        <p>Another hobby I have is gaming, I enjoy a good challenge.
          Recently, I have been playing alot of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
          I enjoy the fighting mechanics and there are too many characters to like in that game.
          I have been playing the SSB series ever since Brawl. Its a fun fighting game series where Nintendo
          characters and other characters from different games culminate into one game and battle. I play
          video games on PC, Xbox and Switch. Gaming is one of my passions that combine with the tech I enjoy.

        <h5>Collecting</h5>
        <p>
          When I have enough money I enjoy going out and collecting comic books, manga and vinyl.
          My favourite things that I have collected so far are vinyls of this band called King
          Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. My favourite record from King Gizzard is
          Polygondwanaland. Their vinyls especially are some of the coolest records I have
          in my collection. The band always releases coloured versions of their records. I can
          never pass up the opportunity to buy their vinyls.
